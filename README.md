### Installation

1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/EinS4ckZwiebeln/IcarusAdvancedAnticheat/releases) for this repository.

2. Extract contents into your `/resources/` directory and ensure dependencies are installed.

3. Read and adjust all configuration files carefully.

### Permission Setup

Following ace permission allows selected players to bypass the anticheat detections and checks.

| icarus.bypass |
| ------------- |

1. Add the permission to the group you want to have bypass perms.

`add_ace group.<yourgroup> icarus.bypass allow`

2. Add the according player license to previous chosen group.

`add_principal identifier.license:<yourlicense> group.<yourgroup>`

### Banning

Numerous anticheat solutions are burdened by extensive ban systems and databases. Icarus, however, sidesteps these complexities to enhance compatibility and eliminate redundant code. To maximize the effectiveness of Icarus, it is imperative to integrate your own ban logic into the script, a process conveniently accomplished through the configuration file.

```lua
-- << config.lua >>
-- This function gets called when a cheater has been caught.
function Config.BanPlayer(source, reason)
    -- Your own banning logic goes here!
end
```
