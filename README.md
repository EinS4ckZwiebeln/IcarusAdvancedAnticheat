While occasional bugs or false positives may occur, your feedback through issues and pull requests is crucial to its refinement. Dive into Icarus, recognizing its evolving state, as it strives to be a powerful and reliable anti-cheat solution for your server.

### Installation

1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/EinS4ckZwiebeln/IcarusAdvancedAnticheat/releases) for this repository.

2. Extract contents into your `/resources/` directory and ensure dependencies are installed.

3. Read and adjust all configuration files carefully.

### Permission Setup

Following ace permission allows selected players to bypass the anticheat detections and checks.

| icarus.bypass |
| ------------- |

1. Add the permission to the group you want to have bypass perms.

`add_ace group.<yourgroup> icarus.bypass allow `

2. Add the according player license to previous chosen group.

`add_principal identifier.license:<yourlicense> group.<yourgroup> `

### Banning

Numerous anticheat solutions are burdened by extensive ban systems and databases. Icarus, however, sidesteps these complexities to enhance compatibility and eliminate redundant code. To maximize the effectiveness of Icarus, it is imperative to integrate your own ban logic into the script, a process conveniently accomplished through the configuration file.

```lua
-- << config.lua >>
-- This function gets called when a cheater has been caught.
function Config.BanPlayer(source, reason)
    -- Your own banning logic goes here!
end
```

### Exports

These exports can be employed to establish a temporary soft-bypass for a specific player. Suppose a script of yours alters the player in a manner that triggers significant false-positives. To mitigate this issue, you can exempt the player by incorporating an excuse just before the problematic code using the provided exports.

| Function               | Parameters                                  | Retval  | Type   |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------- | ------ |
| AddExcuseForPlayer     | source: int; timeout: int, module?: string; | void    | Server |
| RemoveExcuseFromPlayer | source: int; module?: string;               | void    | Server |
| IsPlayerExcused        | source: int; module?: string;               | boolean | Server |

```lua
-- Player won't be able to trigger any detections for 1000ms.
exports["Icarus"]:AddExcuseForPlayer(source, 1000)
exports["Icarus"]:AddExcuseForPlayer(source, 1000, "TestModule") -- Excuse individual module

-- Player won't be able to trigger any detections until his excuse is manually removed.
exports["Icarus"]:AddExcuseForPlayer(source, -1)

-- Player can now trigger all detections again.
exports["Icarus"]:RemoveExcuseFromPlayer(source)
exports["Icarus"]:RemoveExcuseFromPlayer(source, "TestModule") -- Remove excuse for individual module

-- Verify if player is excused for everything or indivual module.
exports["Icarus"]:IsPlayerExcused(source)
exports["Icarus"]:IsPlayerExcused(source, "TestModule")
```
